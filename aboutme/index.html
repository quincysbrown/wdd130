    <h2>Quincy Brown</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone! I am Quincy. I am happy to be here learning with you all! I am currently working towards my
        Bachelors degree in Applied Technology. I am on track to graduate in the summer of this year! Woo Hoo!</p>
    <p>I live in Ogden, Utah with my wife, Anna, and our two little children. Above is a picture of my family from a
        christmas party this last year. </p>
    <p>I am currently working as an IT Support Specialist for Fresenius Medical Care. They are a company that provides
        kidney care for patients around the world. I work as apart of the IT support staff for 5 manufacturing
        facilities across North America. It's pretty neat!</p>
    <p>I have been a life long member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I served a mission in the
        Colorado Denver North Mission in the United States from July of 2017 to July of 2019, and absolutely loved it!
        My wife and I currently serve as Sunday School teachers for the youth in our ward, and love it!</p>
    <p>One of my favorite quotes from our prophet President Russel M. Nelson would be, "The joy we feel has little to do
        with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives." That quote has always
        been a good reminder for me and helped me to keep the focus of my life on our Savior Jesus Christ and living His
        gospel.</p>
