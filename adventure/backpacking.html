                <h1>What is Backpacking?</h1>
                <div id="underline"></div>
                <h4>Backpacking takes hiking to the next level by combining adventure with self-sufficiency. Backpacking
                    easily
                    becomes an immersive outdoor experience providing a unique sense of adventure, self-reliance, and
                    connection to
                    nature. Unlike traditional camping, where you set up at a designated site, backpacking gives you the
                    freedom to
                    travel deeper into the wilderness, experience untouched nature, and sleep under the open sky or in a
                    tent. This
                    activity allows for you to escape the clamor of civilization for a time, challenge yourself
                    physically and
                    mentally, and discover breathtaking landscapes that few get to see. </h4>

                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p> If you're new to backpacking, taking the right approach can make your first trip enjoyable and
                    stress-free. Start
                    with easy overnight trips. Practice basic skills before you go such as setting up your tent or
                    stove, packing gear
                    efficiently, cooking with your stove, fire starting. This can be a hazardous activity so find a
                    friend or group
                    that is experienced with this while you are new. It is also important to condition yourself
                    physically by hiking
                    with loaded packs in varying conditions to strengthen your core, legs, and endurance. Practicing
                    these things will
                    make your first experience backpacking safe, memorable, and enjoyable.
